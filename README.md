# Simple file renamer:
This project will take a file as an input with relative filepaths, and will rename them to the intended filename.

## Basics:
Run down an excel file or CSV file:

Go to location of PDF (in memo) and rename PDF to <account>-<reference>


## Notes:
 - The resulting filename should always be uppercase.
